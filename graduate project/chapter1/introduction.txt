The growth of Agile and the demand of it’s placing on 
QA teams for faster delivery cycles is forcing many to 
replace the older monolithic development models with a 
more streamlined process . However, pervasive method such as 
manual testing are keeping the teams for adopting flexible 
practices like continuous integration and continuous 
delivery and reaching true agility. Continuous integration 
is software practice in which small adjustments to the 
underlying code in an application are verified using 
automated building and testing every time a team member 
makes changes .Continuous delivery is process of getting a 
new builds into production environment as quickly as possible
. In order to provide the true agility we need to develop an
 automated continuous integration, continuous delivery 
pipeline to enable teams to release a constant flow of 
software updates into production to quicken release cycles, 
lower cost and reduce the risk associated with development.
Improving the software processes is commonly agreed to be 
the solution for software companies fighting against delivery
 delays, cost overriding, and quality flaws in the end
