example if we need to test division method we can create two test blocks, the first test blocks for normal inputs and the second is for up normal inputs (division by zero for example). Developer trigger first test block to run, when it finish he is able to get run report while success of this test block trigger the second test block. In case passing first test and fail in the second test, after fixing the code developer is able to start the second test block first and run the first test block as regression test.
